Process synchronization

It is the task phenomenon of coordinating the execution of processes in such a
way that no two processes can have access to the same shared data and
resources.

It is a procedure that is involved in order to preserve the appropriate order of
execution of cooperative processes.

In order to synchronize the processes, there are various synchronization
mechanisms.

Process Synchronization is mainly needed in a multi-process system when
multiple processes are running together, and more than one processes try to

gain access to the same shared resource or any data at the same time

Process synchronization is basically a way to coordinate processes that use shared
resources or data. It is very much essential to ensure synchronized execution of
cooperating processes so that will maintain data consistency. Its main purpose is to share
resources without any interference using mutual exclusion.
